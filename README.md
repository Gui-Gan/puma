# puma_pipe

Data pipe for pulsar observation at IAR. Will eventually include:

1) pulsar_reduc : processing of filterbank files
2) puma_toa : log generator and toa extractor
3) puma_cal : calibration pipe
4) puma_rfi : handles rfi statistics
5) puma_timing : timing pipeline, probably adapted from nanograv.
